Reach inside of me
Feel my empathy
When reality
Takes its toll

Use my clarity
Listen carefully
Feed on energy
From my soul

In the dark of night
I will shine a light
You just follow the
Dotted line

I'll take all the fears
Soak up all the tears
Be your eyes when
You are blind

Chorus
Don't you know
Can't you see
All that you crave you will find in me
All that i am
Is all that you need
I am the cure for the misery
Empathy

When anxiety
Spreads aggressively
I'm your remedy
I'm your gold

When the fire's flickering
Blood is thickening
Pulse is quickening
I'll stay cold

When your sun is setting low
I'm your afterglow
I will be the one
To shine

Best you'll ever find
Pick up anytime
Call me, i'm your
Private line

(Chorus)

I hold bitterly
All inside of me
Fight impurity
Is that a crime?

All the pain in me
Is regrettably
In this weakened heart
Of mine

Didn't you know?
Couldn't you see?
It was your world
How it looked through me

All that you are
Is all that i need
I needed you
For my empathy

Don't you know?
Can't you see?
All that i am
Is all that you need

Empathy
