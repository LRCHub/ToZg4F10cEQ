Love, love, love, love, love
I Find you're something

Love, love, love, love, love

Pulma Gary Payton,
Live in your rotation
All your plexy clad I'm snapping
back upon your station
Keep style elevating,
you feelin' the sensation
To a higher zone,
you are not alone
I know no perimeters,
frequency,no limiters
We multiply integers,
we back and forth so limitless
I'm positive, negative
combined with infinity
You can grab a line
on a line this is synergy
Love, love,
Anything you feel
Love, love
I can feel too
Love, love, love
Anything you feel
Love love
I can feel too
You're higher zone, High
You're higher zone
(Hands high)...
Hands high, hands high
Anything you feel
Hands high, hands high
I can feel too
Hands high, hands high,
Anything you feel
Hands high, hands high
I can feel too
Hands high
